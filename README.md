These are really really old programs.  It turns out, after
some investigation, that I seem to have wrote them :-). I
have recently picked them up again. The idea is to convert
between ASCII art and PNM the netpbm way, with decent
quality in each direction.  (My asciiarttopgm, BTW, is *way*
better than the asciitopgm currently in Netpbm of any
stripe.)

Of course, a development install of Netpbm
(http://netpbm.sourceforge.net) is necessary to build this
stuff. It is also supposed to build and run with the ancient
ancient Debian netpbm-dev, although I am no longer testing
this after having had it work once. There are substantial
bugs, defects and fail in the Debian stuff anyhow, so
probably better to just avoid it and install the real thing
from the net.  Sad---I don't have to say that very often.

Building the included glyphshades utility, and thus
being able to produce or reproduce shade files for font
density information, requires a development install of Cairo
(http://cairographics.org). Otherwise, you'll have to dig
the files you need to build this out of the distribution
tarball, as they're not checked into Git for sanity reasons.

This stuff represents a crazy amount of tweaking. Have fun
doing more if you like.
