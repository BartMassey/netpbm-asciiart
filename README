These are really really old programs that I wrote.  The idea
is to convert between ASCII and PNM.  My asciitopgm, BTW, is
way better than the one in netpbm.

There's no manual pages here, though there should be. Things
are maybe clear enough.

This stuff represents a crazy amount of tweaking. Have fun doing
more if you like.
