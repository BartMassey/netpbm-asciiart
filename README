These are really really old programs that it turns out,
after some investigation, that I wrote :-). I have recently
picked them up again.  The idea is to convert between ASCII
art and PNM the netpbm way, with decent quality in each
direction.  (My asciiarttopgm, BTW, is *way* better than the
asciitopgm currently in netpbm.)

Of course, a development install of Netpbm
(http://netpbm.sourceforge.net) is necessary to build this
stuff.  Building the included glyphshades utility, and thus
being able to produce or reproduce shade files for font
density information, requires a development install of Cairo
(http://cairographics.org). Otherwise, you'll have to dig
the files you need to build this out of the distribution
tarball, as they're not checked into Git for sanity reasons.

This stuff represents a crazy amount of tweaking. Have fun
doing more if you like.
