These are really really old programs that I wrote, and have
recently picked up again.  The idea is to convert between
ASCII and PNM.  My asciitopgm, BTW, is *way* better than the
one currently in netpbm.

The build process currently depends on having a development
install of Cairo (http://cairographics.org); this is used to
get font density information.  Of course, a development
install of Netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net) is also
necessary.

This stuff represents a crazy amount of tweaking. Have fun
doing more if you like.
