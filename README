These are really really old programs that I wrote.  OK, I'm
not actually positive I wrote asciitopbm.c, but I think I
did.  The idea is to convert between ASCII and PNM.

There's no manual pages here, though there should be. Things
are maybe clear enough.

This stuff represents a crazy amount of tweaking. Have fun doing
more if you like.
