.SH NAME
mkasciiart \- conveniently convert PGM to ASCII art
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkasciiart
.RI [ options... ] [pgmtoasciiart options...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmkasciiart\fP takes \fInetpbm\fP PGM format on standard
input (NOTE: does not accept a filename argument) and
converts it to "ASCII art" using
.BR pgmtoasciiart (1)
and other
.BR netpbm (1)
utilities.
.PP
This is a convenience shell script that embodies some
heuristics for quality conversion that the author found
useful.  It also serves as an example of
.BR pgmtoasciiart (1)
usage.
.PP
This script accepts arguments that it passes on to
\fBpgmtoasciiart\fP(1).  The \fBmkasciiart\fP-specific
arguments must come before the \fBpgmtoasciiart\fP
arguments.
.SH USAGE
.PP
Options are as follows:
.BI "-width " cols
Produce ASCII art that is \fIcols\fP columns wide. Default
is 132 columns, because the author is \fIold\fP.
.TP
.BI "-yscale " aspect
ASCII characters are a lot taller than they are wide, and
leading makes this more pronounced.  The unitless number
\fIaspect\fP, which defaults to 2.5, is the assumed ratio of
\fIy\fP to \fIx\fP size for characters.
.TP
.BI "-preview " width
Instead of invoking
.BR pgmtoasciiart (1),
produce a PGM of the given pixel \fIwidth\fP on standard
output, showing what the preprocessed image looks like
before final conversion to ASCII.  Mostly useful for
debugging. Do not pass any
.B pgmtoasciiart
arguments along with this flag.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The \fIyscale\fP should be automatically derived from the
font information.  This is trivial, but communicating the
information to the shell script is less so, so it has not
yet been done.
.PP
Maybe
.B mkasciiart
should take an optional file argument for conversion.  It
currently does not, because it is usually used as part of a
pipeline; it did not seem worth the (substantial) hassle to
add this feature.
