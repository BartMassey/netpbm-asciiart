.SH NAME
asciitopbm \- convert ASCII art to PBM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B asciitopbm
.RI [ options... ]
.RI [ filename ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBasciitopbm\fP takes "ASCII art" and converts
it to \fInetpbm\fP PBM format, expanding it in the
process into a rectangular "output cell" per character,
which is shaded using halftoning techniques.
.SH USAGE
.PP
Options are as follows:
.TP
.BI "-cwidth " pixels
Gives the pixel-width of the graphical output cell corresponding
to a given input character.
.TP
.BI "-cheight " pixels
Gives the pixel-height of the graphical output cell corresponding
to a given input character.
.TP
.BI "-contrast " scale
Sets the contrast of the output image according to the given
\fIscale\fP factor, which should be between 0 and 1.
.TP
.BI "-mesh " scale
Sets the mesh screen depth of the output image according to the given
\fIscale\fP factor, which should be between 0 and 1.  A
primitive mesh screen is applied to the image in an attempt
to get better bitmap halftones.
.TP
.BI "-scale " string
The given \fIstring\fP is treated as a list of ASCII
characters by increasing black density.  The output grey
level for an input character will be determined by the
position of the character in this list.  Characters not in
the list will be treated as black.  The space character is
always white, and should be omitted.
.TP
.BI "-font " tag
The given font \fItag\fP is used to determine which built-in scale to
use. Different fonts have different character densities, so this
argument may be useful in dealing with ASCII art that was
produced with a particular font in mind.  Available
font tags as of this writing are "sans", which corresponds
to \fIBitstream Vera Sans Mono\fP, and "typewriter", which
corresponds to \fICourier New\fP.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The functionality of this program is largely
a matter of convenience.
For better quality, it is probably best to use \fBasciitopgm\fP
and postprocess the result using \fInetpbm\fP.
.PP
The output cells of the bitmap are produced by a bilinear
shader.  This does an OK job, but it could definitely be improved.
.PP
The font tones have been measured automatically by rendering
characters. Character patterning is in no way taken into
account in this process.
